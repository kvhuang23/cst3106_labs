# Hospital Triage App Design Document

## Design Overview
The Hospital Triage App will provide an intuitive interface for both patients and administrative staff to manage and navigate through the emergency room process. The design will focus on ease of use, accessibility, and efficiency.

## Fonts
- **Arial**: Utilized for all headings, button texts, and other stand-out elements due to its clean, modern look and high legibility on digital screens.
- **Times New Roman**: Employed for all body text to differentiate it from headings and provide a comfortable reading experience for longer paragraphs.

## Colour Palette
- **User Interface**:
  - **Calming Blue**: Used for primary buttons and headings to create a soothing environment for patients.
  - **Neutral Grey**: Used for background elements to reduce visual strain.
- **Admin Interface**:
  - **Dark Grey**: Used for the primary interface elements to denote seriousness and authority.
  - **Red Accents**: Used for alerts and urgent actions to draw attention.

## App Components
- **Titles**: "Hospital Triage - User" for the patient interface and "Hospital Triage - Admin" for the administrative interface, prominently displayed in Arial.
- **Buttons**: Rectangular with rounded edges, colored according to the page-specific palette, and featuring a bold, legible font.
- **Input Fields**: Outlined with sufficient padding, featuring placeholder text for guidance.
- **Patient Questionnaire**: A form on the user page to collect data about the type of injury and pain level, with options presented in a clear and straightforward manner.
- **Admin Summary**: A dashboard on the admin page showcasing patient wait times and conditions, with interactive controls to adjust the urgency level and manage patient flow.

## Layout and Navigation
- A responsive, grid-based layout will be used to accommodate various devices, with a focus on mobile-first design.
- Clear, logical navigation will be implemented, with a fixed bottom bar on mobile views and a top bar for desktops, ensuring key actions are always within easy reach.

## Consistency
- A cohesive visual identity will be maintained throughout the application with the consistent use of colors, fonts, and styling of elements.
- Interaction design will be standardized across the app to promote an intuitive user experience where users can predict the behavior of elements.

## Component Integration
- The **titles**, **description**, and **questionnaire** for the user page, along with the **admin summary** and action buttons on the admin page, will be designed to ensure that users can quickly understand and navigate the app, making the triage process as efficient as possible.

## Functionality
- The app will enable patients to submit their medical issues quickly, and staff to process and prioritize these issues efficiently. The design will cater to a high-paced, potentially high-stress environment, emphasizing clarity and speed.
